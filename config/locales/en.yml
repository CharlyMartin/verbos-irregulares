      why: "Why such a method"
      why-text: |
        Learning English irregular verbs is not especially hard.
        The problem comes from the method we use to do so.
        Reading a list of English irregular verbs is both boring and uneficient.
        After talking to several English teachers, including Beatriz,
        we have developped this interactive, personalised and effective tool for you.

      benefits1: "An active learning"
      benefits1-text: |
        Reading a list of verbs is passive.
        Our method consists in a playful software through which you will learn irregular
        verbs way in a proactive way.
        You can learn them 80% faster than with the regular paper list, guaranteed!
      benefits2: "A personalised learning"
      benefits2-text: |
       With the regular method, we spend most of our time reading the verbs we already know.
       Thanks to our method, the software knows where on which verb you struggle most
       and emphasizes on them.
       You are way more likely to know them this way.

      testimonials-teacher: |
        I tried to teach English irregular verbs between each lesson to my students.
        It took them several months to learn and was very daunting.
        With this method, we achieved great results in less than a month.
      testimonials-employee: |
        I had to learn English for professional reasons and didn't really have
        the time to spend hours on it.
        Irregular verbs were a true blocking point in my English learning progress.
        With this application, in a few sessions it was settled.
        To my opinion, the return on investment is indisputable.
